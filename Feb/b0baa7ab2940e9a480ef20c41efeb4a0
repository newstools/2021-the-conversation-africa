In response to COVID-19, governments around the world, including Nigeria, adopted lockdown measures to curtail the spread of the coronavirus. As expected, these measures were generally unfavourable to businesses and livelihoods. Nigeria is yet to recover from the blows to its already faltering and largely informal economy. In today’s episode of Pasha, Ndubuisi Nwokoma discusses the impact of COVID-19 on the Nigerian economy and the government’s recovery plan. He is professor of economics and director of the Centre for Economic Policy Analysis and Research at the University of Lagos. Photo:
