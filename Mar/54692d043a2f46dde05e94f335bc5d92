Insecurity is common throughout Nigeria. But the northern region is the worst affected because of attacks by the terror group Boko Haram, banditry, kidnappings and conflict between farmers and herdsmen. The chaos has led to the closure of some schools and a feeling of helplessness among citizens in states where attacks are on the increase. Sheriff Folarin, a professor of political science and a peace and conflict scholar, blames the current state of affairs on successive governments that have failed to tackle the underlying causes. He also offers some solutions on dealing with insecurity in the country. Music:
