Most developed countries are in the advanced stages of COVID-19 vaccination rollouts. But a large number of developing countries, including most across Africa, are still at the early stages, mainly due to a shortage of shots. African countries are trying to overcome the shortfall by using a multi-pronged approach to secure vaccines. This includes sourcing them through: the COVAX facility. This is a global initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. Itâ€™s led by global health organisations including Gavi, the vaccine alliance, the World Health Organisation, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations; the COVID-19 African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team, which was established by the African Union; bilateral agreements with the manufacturers, and donations from other countries. To help you keep track of the progress of COVID-19 vaccine rollouts in African countries, we have developed a map that will be updated daily, showing how many people have been vaccinated across the continent. </p>
